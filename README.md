# FractalCrystal

This is the monorepo for an as of yet unnamed project, for now the placeholder FractalCrystal is used.

## Setup

This project uses both cargo workspaces and for the Rust components and pnpm workspaces in conjuction with Nx for dependency linking. As a task runner [just](https://github.com/casey/just) is used for QoL but you can run all the cargo an Nx/npm commands manually
